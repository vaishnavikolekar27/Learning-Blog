		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<center><h2>Best platform for C learning</h2></center>
		<p style="font-size: 130%">When I started learning C/C++ in college, I found that there was a lack of simple tutorials with examples. There wasnâ€™t any official documentation as well and it was really hard for students like me to find information that is simple to grasp.
In my free time, I started writing tutorials and sharing them on c after late 2016. What started as a hobby has now grown into a full-time job.</p>
<br>
	<p style="font-size: 130%">Our main focus at learner blog is simplicity. There are programmers all over the world of different levels of programming experience and having different English proficiency.
